## Version II of reference SNP+TR haplotype panel for imputation of TR variants

### Dataset description

[Phased variants](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/working/20220422_3202_phased_SNV_INDEL_SV/) of 3,202 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP).

TRs imputed from 3,202 1kGP samples.

Total 70,692,015 variants + 1,091,550 TR markers.

All the coordinates are based on **hg38** human reference genome.
